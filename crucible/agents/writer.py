Given a code diff and a list of requirements, write a complete pytest test file.

Rules — follow all of them strictly:
1. Return ONLY raw Python code. No markdown. No triple-backtick fences. No explanation.
2. Tag every test function with @pytest.mark.req_id("<id>") using the req_id from the requirements list.
3. Cover: happy paths, edge cases (None, empty, boundary values), error paths (exceptions), type coercions.
4. Use pytest.mark.parametrize for data-driven cases.
5. Each test must have a docstring: one sentence explaining what it verifies.
6. Import only from the standard library and pytest — do not import the module under test unless the diff is provided with its full path.
7. If you cannot determine the module path from the diff, use a mock or stub.
8. Never use time.sleep(), datetime.now(), random without a seed, hardcoded ports, or global state — these are FRAGILE and will be flagged."""
